# EWB Hackathon 2024
# Overview
At the heart of our hackathon lies a profound belief in the power of engineering not just as a technical discipline, but as a force for societal good. With the overarching theme of instilling a sense of responsibility and a desire to utilize engineering skills for the betterment of society, we present the Moral Code Hackathon. This unique event challenges participants to transcend mere technical prowess and embrace a higher callingâ€”to become agents of positive change. In a world where technological advancements often outpace ethical considerations, we aim to foster a culture of conscientious innovation. Participants will be tasked with addressing pressing societal challenges, ranging from sustainability and social justice to healthcare and education. By harnessing their engineering acumen and creativity, participants will not only develop tangible solutions but also cultivate a deeper understanding of their moral and ethical responsibilities as future engineers. Through collaboration, mentorship, and unwavering commitment to integrity, the Moral Code Hackathon seeks to empower the next generation of engineers to lead with compassion, empathy, and a steadfast dedication to using their skills for the betterment of humanity.
